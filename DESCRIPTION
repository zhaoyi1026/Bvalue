Description: Calculates B-value and empirical equivalence bound. B-value is defined as the maximum magnitude of a confidence interval; and the empirical equivalence bound is the minimum B-value at a certain level. A new two-stage procedure for hypothesis testing is proposed, where the first stage is conventional hypothesis testing and the second is an equivalence testing procedure using the introduced empirical equivalence bound. See Zhao et al. (2019) "B-Value and Empirical Equivalence Bound: A New Procedure of Hypothesis Testing" <arXiv:1912.13084> for details.
